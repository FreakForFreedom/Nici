Endless Continuum - Beyond

Rough was the landing in the mud. On his way down, he 
inadvertently thought of the last message he left his 
joyous little bother back at home. A strange message, 
not quite easy to decipher, would tell him of an highly
diabolical plan to take over the world. But would he be
able to comprehend, to imagine this futuristic vision
even with his young age? As immortals, both of their
lives were still young, him being only 128 years old.
